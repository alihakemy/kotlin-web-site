[//]: # (title: Kotlin for Android)

Android mobile development has been Kotlin-first since Google I/O in 2019.
> Over 50% of professional Android developers use Kotlin as their primary language. In contrast, only 30% use Java as the primary.
> 
> 70% of devs whose primary language is Kotlin say that Kotlin makes them more productive.

Using Kotlin for Android development, you can benefit from:

* **Less code combined with greater readability**. Spend less time writing your code and working to understand the code of others.
* **Less common errors**. Apps built with Kotlin are 20% less likely to crash (based on [Google's internal data](https://medium.com/androiddevelopers/fewer-crashes-and-more-stability-with-kotlin-b606c6a6ac04)).
* **Kotlin support in Android Jetpack and other libraries**. [Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose) is Android’s recommended modern toolkit for building native UI in Kotlin. [KTX extensions](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/ktx) add Kotlin language features,
  such as coroutines, extension functions, lambdas, and named parameters, to existing Android libraries.
* **Support for multiplatform development**. Kotlin Multiplatform enables developing not only Android but also [iOS](https://kotlinlang.org/lp/mobile/), backend, and web applications.
  [Compose Multiplatform](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/compose-multiplatform/), a JetBrains' declarative UI framework based on Kotlin and Jetpack Compose, allows sharing UIs across platforms – iOS, Android, desktop, and web.
* **Mature language and environment**. Since its creation in 2011, Kotlin has developed continuously, not only as a language 
but as a whole ecosystem with robust tooling. Now it's seamlessly integrated in Android Studio and is actively used by many companies 
for developing Android applications.
* **Interoperability with Java**. You can use Kotlin along with the Java programming language in your applications without needing to migrate all your code 
to Kotlin.
* **Easy learning**. Kotlin is very easy to learn, especially for Java developers.
* **Big community**. Kotlin has great support and many contributions from the community, which is growing all over the world.
  Nearly 95% of the top 1K Android apps use Kotlin.

Many startups and Fortune 500 companies have already developed Android applications using Kotlin – see the list at [the Google website for Kotlin developers](https://developer.android.com/kotlin).
